# ShellScriptBackup
This is just a example how to make a backup scheme for your system using shellscript. In here, I`m just learning how to create nice and clean ShellScript codes.

In this backup i put the example of
   * Make backup and restore backup from MySQL
   * Make backup and restore backup from Postgree
   * Make backup and restore backup from some folders

## Running
First, you need to give the Execute permission to the script.
```
  $ chmod +x backupscript.sh
```

Now, just execute in the shell
```
  $./backupscript.sh
```
